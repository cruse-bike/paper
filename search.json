This means that high levels of geographic resolution are needed in the data used to estimate cycling potential. However, datasets on travel patterns are often only available at the level of administrative zones. The Central Statistics Office (CSO) in Ireland provides Place of Work, School or College Census of Anonymised Records (POWSCAR) data on the number of people travelling to work and school at the Electoral Division (ED) level, for example.\nThe method used to convert OD data to route networks used in the PCT was to calculate a single route between the population weighted centroids associated with each OD pair. This method works fine when the OD data represents movement between small areas, but was not appropriate for generating route networks from the POWSCAR data because zone centroids are so far apart that the resulting route networks would be sparse and unrealistic. To tackle this issue we developed a new method for OD data disaggregation called ‘jittering’ (Lovelace et al., 2022). The method works by first disaggregating the OD data based on a ‘disaggregation threshold’ and then assigning each disaggregated ‘sub-OD’ pair to ‘subpoints’ within each zone. As shown in Figure 1, the resulting route networks are dense, even in rural areas."

    "text": "2.3 Routing\nRoutes in CRUSE are generated by CycleStreets, a not-for profit transport consultancy and web development company who provide application programming interfaces (APIs) supplying a range of datasets for cycle planning and advocacy. Although based in Cambridge, UK, CycleStreets provide routing services ‘by cyclists, for cyclists’ internationally, including in Ireland. The CycleStreets routing engine is based on OpenStreetMap (OSM) data, which is continuously updated by a global community of volunteers.\nCycleStreets’ services can be used by anyone for free, but we commissioned a bespoke routing service for CRUSE for the following reasons, to enable:\n\nCalculation of hundreds-of-thousands of routes, which is against the terms of service of the free API.\nMaking changes to the routing profiles, including allowing routing on trunk roads, which are not permitted in the default routing profiles.\nControl over the version of OSM data being used for the routing, allowing regular updates to the route networks as OSM data is updated.\n\nWe calculated three network types for each disaggregated (‘jittered’) OD pair: ‘Fastest’, ‘Balanced’ and ‘Quietest’. As outlined on the CycleStreets’ website, the ‘Fastest’ routes minimise journey time, accounting for traffic lights and surface type. The ‘Quietest’ route type minimises busy sections of road, allowing high ‘diversion factors’ from the fastest route on quieter but less direct ways (often avoiding roads and interactions with motor vehicles altogether where possible). The ‘Balanced’ route type is a compromise between the two, minimising journey time while avoiding the busiest roads. Allowing users to switch between these three route types enables them to consider the trade-offs between directness and ‘cycle friendliness’ when planning new infrastructure, as shown in Figure 3.\nThese map are available on the ‘Route types’ page for each county (see cruse.bike/limerick/route-types). In addition to showing the estimated routes under each scenario, the page also presents summary statistics on the network:\n\nOn the fastest network, 25% of the distance cycled occurs in non-hostile segments and 6% in cycle-friendly segments.\nUnder the baseline scenario, 55% of the distance cycled on the quietest network occurs in non-hostile segments and 13% in cycle-friendly segments.\n\nThese statistics can be revealing: in Limerick it suggests that around half of all cycling activity occurs on network segments that are hostile (with a high inferred level of traffic stress), even when efforts are taken to avoid busy segments. For the Fastest network, which may be more realistic for utility cycling, the proportion of cycling on hostile segments is even higher at 75%.\nTODO: Add description of route types in Limerick based on local knowledge and Figure 3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Illustration of the Fastest and Quietest route networks for central and East Limmerick."

Each of these scenarios is described below, as illustrated in Figure Figure 4. \n\n\n\nFigure 4: Distance-mode share graph for Limerick used to communicate the different scenarios. Source: county level view for Limerick in the open access CRUSE Tool at https://cruse.bike/limerick.\n\n\n\n2.4.1 Baseline\nThe Baseline scenario approximates current cycling levels. As outlined in Section 2.2, the Baseline scenario includes travel to work and school, and additional trip purposes. Cycling levels were taken from the POWSCAR data, which includes the number of people travelling by each mode between each OD pair.\n\n\n2.4.2 Near Market\nThe Near Market scenario approximates the level of cycling that would be achieved if levels of cycling uptake observed in areas of Ireland with high levels of cycling according to the 2016 Census were achieved everywhere, accounting for differences in trip distances and hilliness levels. The scenario is implemented as follows:\n\nCalculate distance decay curves for Dublin for the base year (2016, using POWSCAR data) by fitting a model to the relevant OD data after it has been converted to a route network datasest\nApply the Near Market model to the hilliness and distance values for each county during the build process\nAdd the current level of cycling to the Near Market model\n\n\n\n2.4.3 Climate Action Plan\nThe Climate Action Plan scenario is loosely based on the Irish Government’s Climate Action Plan 2021, which contains policies for action to achieve a 51% reduction in overall greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, on a path towards net-zero by 2050. For transport, this includes 500,000 extra walking, cycling and public transport trips per day by 2030. In terms of car travel, the target is to “Increas[e] the proportion of kilometres driven by passenger electric cars to between 40 and 45% by 2030, in addition to a reduction of 10% in kilometres driven by the remaining internal combustion engine cars.” This equates to a 5.5 to 6% reduction in total car km driven.\nTo model this decrease in car driver km, cycling uptake increases in line with the Go Dutch scenario. However, we only model shift from driving to cycling. There is no shift from other modes of transport to cycling.\n\n\n2.4.4 Go Dutch\nUnder the Go Dutch scenario cycling reaches levels equivalent to those found in the Netherlands, taking account of the effects of route hilliness (measured as mean gradient) and route distance. This scenario uses the same model that was used PCT, allowing trips to shift from any other mode to cycling (Lovelace et al., 2017)."
