    "text": "2.1 Disaggregation of origin-destination data\nA feature of active travel interventions is that they require dense networks of routes to be effective (Parkin, 2018). This means that high levels of geographic resolution are needed in the data used to estimate cycling potential. However, datasets on travel patterns are often only available at the level of administrative zones. The Central Statistics Office (CSO) in Ireland provides Place of Work, School or College Census of Anonymised Records (POWSCAR) data on the number of people travelling to work and school at the Electoral Division (ED) level, for example.\nThe method used to convert OD data to route networks used in the PCT was to calculate a single route between the population weighted centroids associated with each OD pair. This method works fine when the OD data represents movement between small areas, but was not appropriate for generating route networks from the POWSCAR data because zone centroids are so far apart that the resulting route networks would be sparse and unrealistic. To tackle this issue we developed a new method for OD data disaggregation called ‘jittering’ (Lovelace et al., 2022). The method works by first disaggregating the OD data based on a ‘disaggregation threshold’ and then assigning each disaggregated ‘sub-OD’ pair to ‘subpoints’ within each zone. As shown in Figure 1, the resulting route networks are dense, even in rural areas."

    "text": "2.2 Additional trip purposes\nA limitation of the original PCT was that it only included travel to work data. This was partially addressed by the inclusion of travel to school based on data from the Department for Education in England (Goodman et al., 2019). An advantage of the POWSCAR OD data over OD datasets derived from census surveys in many countries is that it includes travel to school data. We commissioned a version of POWSCAR that included a breakdown of the total flows between OD pairs by purpose and mode, enabling a more realistic estimation of the ‘Baseline’ cycling network.\nHowever, travel to school and work only constitute around only 30% of all trips in Ireland. To overcome this issue, we developed a spatial interaction modelling methodology to estimate the number of trips between each OD pair for additional trip purposes. The classification of trip purposes used in the CRUSE Tool was guided mainly by the trip purpose classification found within the National Household Travel Survey (NHTS), but with the addition of categories based on the comprehensive POWSCAR data, and the need to include recreational trips and multi-stage trips (not yet implemented). An overview of the trip purposes used in CRUSE is presented in Figure 2.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Trip purposes used in the CRUSE Tool."

    "text": "2.3 User interface\nThe CRUSE web application is statically hosted, meaning that it can be accessed without the need for a server running software such as the R package ‘shiny’ or Python packages such as ‘streamlit’ or ‘flask’ in the background (Wickham, 2021). Typical intended user stories are illustrated in Figure 3, which shows that the tool is designed to be used by both professional and non-professional users. For the main target audience, professional transport planners working at the county level, the tool provides a range of outputs, including estimates of cycling potential at the county and network level. The provision of balanced (the default), quietest and fastest route networks enables planners to consider the trade-offs between directness and ‘cycle friendliness’ when planning new infrastructure. The tool also provides data downloads, enabling estimates of cycling potential on the network to be visualised and analysed with other tools such as QGIS, Python or R.\nFor non-professional users, the tool provides a simple interface to explore the cycling potential of the network. By providing a single landing page that is suitable for both professional and non-professional users (such as an advocate or parent interested in safe routes to school), the tool aims to facilitate communication between these groups.\n\n\n\n\n\ngraph LR\n    A(Professional user) --&gt; B[CRUSE landing page]\n    B --&gt; C[CRUSE national map]\n    C --&gt; D[CRUSE county map]\n    D --&gt; F[Full county map]\n    D --&gt; CS[County statistics]\n    D --&gt; Q[Quiet and fast route networks]\n    D --&gt; DD[Data downloads]\n    DD --&gt; EX{External tools}\n    X(Non-professional user) --&gt; Y[CRUSE landing page]\n    Y --&gt; Z[CRUSE national map]\n    Z --&gt; R[CRUSE county level results]\n    Z --&gt; E(Exploration)\n    R --&gt; E\n    E --&gt; COMS{Communication}\n\n\nFigure 3: Hypothetical user stories for the CRUSE Tool illustrating that it can be used in different ways by different user groups."
