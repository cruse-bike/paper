\begin{abstract}
Under the EU Road infrastructure safety management (RISM) directive, the
National Road Safety Strategy (RSS), and the Climate Action Plan
Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) has a remit for road safety and
decarbonizing a predominantly road-based network in Ireland.

To address data needs for both safety, business case development and
project evaluation on the National Road Network (NRN), the Cycle Route
Uptake and Scenario Estimation (CRUSE) Tool was developed. Cycling in
Ireland represents only 3\% of total modal share as of the latest Census
(2016), but accounts for 20\% of serious injuries and 7\% of all
fatalities. High resolution datasets on baseline and potential cycling
levels are needed to meet Ireland's climate and safety targets.

Due to an absence of reliable data, particularly rural cycling levels,
TII commissioned the Institute for Transport Studies (ITS) at the
University of Leeds and AECOM to develop a new tool for this purpose.
ITS Leeds led the development of the PCT for England and Wales, which
has ``revolutionized the practice of strategic cycle planning
nationally''. The tool is an open-source approach using recognized
open-source methodology to enable planners, engineers, and other
stakeholders to make evidence-based decisions for the NRN. CRUSE is
available at \url{https://cruse.bike/} and builds on the Propensity to
Cycle Tool (PCT) for England and Wales. CRUSE goes beyond the PCT in
several important ways, modeling denser networks at higher levels of
geographic resolution and additional purposes, including simulated
recreational, social, shopping and personal trips, in addition trips to
work and primary, secondary and tertiary education locations. The tool
provides key `denominator' information to enable reporting of collision
rates per billion km cycled.

CRUSE is structured in a similar way to the traditional four-stage
transport model, but its use of Open Street Map (OSM) data, used by
\href{https://www.cyclestreets.net/}{Cyclestreets.net} for routing,
enables network quality to be assessed without costly surveys to record
new infrastructure. OSM tags generate ``cycle friendliness'' estimates
of all links on the network, based on existing recorded infrastructure.
Many networks are provided, highlighting routes for directness (Fastest)
and ``cycle friendliness'' (Quietest). It uses origin and destination
data from the 2016 Census in combination with modeled demand data to
estimate current and potential future cycling levels at area, route, and
network levels for each county in Ireland.

For investment in cycling to deliver on the huge potential benefits,
cycling must become safer. With growth in the E-bike market, the tool
will help inform inter-urban and rural networks to support the transfer
of trips to sustainable modes for longer journeys. The findings and
resulting tool are directly relevant to addressing the challenges and
opportunities faced by National Road Authorities (NRAs) across Ireland.
The provision of open access evidence, that can be used non-experts and
professionals, is relevant to countries with sustainable transport
policies worldwide.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

Mobility kills. High energy transport systems are a major contributor to
climate change, a leading cause of premature death and injury due to
road traffic collisions, and a cause of disease due to airborne
pollutants. Conversely, evidence-based and effective transport
\emph{policies} have great potential to decarbonize economies, improve
public health, and save lives.

Transport is responsible for 23\% of global greenhouse gas emissions,
70\% of which are from road transport, nearly half of which (around 10\%
of global emissions) is from passenger cars \citep{jaramillo2022}. The
transport system encourages, enables and in some cases enforces
unsustainable lifestyles. Services that are only accessible by car
lock-in car dependency
\citep{gray2001, shergold2012, motte-baumvol2010}.

Recognizing the growing evidence of such impacts of poorly designed and
performing transport systems, governments in many countries have set
targets and taken actions. In the context of climate, road safety and
physicial inactivity crises, policies to improve transport systems can
be classified according to the `Avoid-Shift-Improve' (ASI) framework
\citep{jaramillo2022}. The framework highlights the importance of demand
reduction (\emph{avoid}ing unnecessary trips), in addition to mode
\emph{shift} to sustainable modes and \emph{improvement} of existing
energy converters, in that order.

Uptake of cycling, the main topic of this paper, should be seen in this
broader context of transport decarbonisation \citep{brand2020} and
sustainable mobility \citep{burns2013}. Although cycling uptake appears
on the surface to only relate to the `shift' part of the ASI framework,
closer consideration of the knock-on impacts of cycling uptake shows
that it can also help avoid unnecessary trips \citep{nello-deakin2020}.
Furthermore, highly efficient e-bikes --- which are seeing rapid uptake
in Ireland and other countries --- outperform electric cars, which are
too heavy and expensive. Over-reliance on electric cars could slow the
transition away from car dependency and inadvertently enable ``high
travel lock-in'' \citep{anable2019}. At the European level, the European
Union has a target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 55\% by 2030,
compared to 1990 levels, and to achieve `net-zero' by 2050.\footnote{https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?u
  ri=celex\%3A32008L0096}

Regarding road traffic casualties, another deadly consequence of
inefficient transport systems, the Road Infrastructure Safety Management
(RISM) directive (2008/96/EC) requires member states to implement a road
safety management system (RSMS) for all public roads. Specifically,
``Member States shall ensure that the ranking of high accident
concentration sections and the network safety ranking are carried
out''.\footnote{https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?u
  ri=celex\%3A32008L0096} Given that `safety' in this context is
usefully quantified as the number of people killed and seriously injured
(KSI) per distance travelled, the directive requires estimation of
distance travelled by mode, down to the road link level. For active
modes, about which there is a paucity of data compared with motorized
modes, this is a major challenge. Better data to inform road safety
policies and interventions is a motivation for the CRUSE Tool outlined
in this paper, and modeling active travel more broadly.

In Ireland, the Road Safety Authority (RSA) has set the target of
halving the number of road traffic deaths and serious injuries by
2030.\footnote{\url{https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/774e2-national-development-plan-2021-2030/}}
Doing so while simultaneously enabling rapid uptake of active modes will
require key active travel routes to be identified and improved.

A proactive approach to the development of cycling policy and
infrastructure is taking place in Ireland. The main frameworks
underpinning these efforts are the Climate Action Plan\footnote{\url{https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/7bd8c-climate-action-plan-2023/}},
the National Development Plan\footnote{\url{https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/774e2-national-development-plan-2021-2030/}},
and the National Roads 2040 strategy\footnote{
  https://www.tii.ie/tii-library/strategic-planning/national-roads-2040/TII-NR2040-Final-Report-EN-April-2023.pdf}.
These policy frameworks are backed-up by public support for active
travel interventions: while only 3\% of trips in Ireland are made by
cycling according to the latest Census data from 2016,\footnote{
  https://assets.gov.ie/42950/f789b2fcfb144441822f58236986eeea.pdf}
``83\% of respondents supported enhanced walking and cycling
facilities''.

At the regional level, the recently published Greater Dublin Area
Transport Strategy\footnote{\url{https://www.nationaltransport.ie/planning-and-investment/strategic-planning/greater-dublin-area-transport-strategy/}}
reinforces these findings: ``nearly a quarter of adults cycle at least
once a week in the Dublin Metropolitan Area'' with cycling in the Dublin
area taking up to 60,000 cars off the road today. Extrapolating this on
a per population basis across Ireland, with around 40\% of the
population living in Dublin, this suggests that around 150,000 cars
could be removed nationwide just by achieving Dublin levels of cycling
in all counties (notwithstanding existing cycling trips and differences
in trip distances). 7 in 10 trips in Ireland are by car\footnote{
  https://www.nationaltransport.ie/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/National\_Household\_Travel\_Survey\_2017\_Report\_-\_December\_2018.pdf}.
Cycling has the potential to replace a large proportion of these trips:
``A high priority must also be given to cyclists, because trips by this
mode have the potential to replace trips by private car, most
specifically for short to medium distance trips, but increasingly for
longer trips as e-bikes extend the range of this mode''\footnote{
  https://www.nationaltransport.ie/planning-and-investment/strategic-planning/greater-dublin-area-transport-strategy/}.

Further evidence of the importance of cycling in Ireland \emph{already}
is provided by the National Strategic Objective (NSO) from the National
Development Plan, with €8.6 billion allocated to sustainable transport
infrastructure including public transport and active travel
interventions. Cycle infrastructure will be developed in synchrony with
the BusConnects project, an entire redesign of the bus network in Dublin
and Cork.

It was in this context that Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII)
commissioned the Cycle Route Uptake and Scenario Estimation (CRUSE)
project. Based on the Propensity to Cycle Tool (PCT) for England and
Wales, the CRUSE Tool was developed to provide evidence on current
cycling levels and future cycling potential nationwide across Ireland.

A key consideration for TII is to ensure both urban and rural Ireland
were targeted for cycling infrastructure, as shown in
Figure~\ref{fig-dublin}. To this end, TII extensively reviewed activity
on Irish Roads and how the road network was being used by commuters,
cyclists, heavy goods vehicles and other road users across the Irish
transport network. The aim was for the tool to provide strong, national,
systematic but locally-specific evidence to monitor cycling friendliness
and safety in Ireland, to ensure strategic alignment with national,
regional and local policies. The open source and publicly available
nature of the tool ensures more inclusive and evidence-based
conversations around cycle network planning between all stakeholders in
the transport planning process. Other use cases in the Irish context
includes monitoring the need for existing cycling infrastructure
upgrades, undertaking appraisal for business case development, as well
as safety and exposure information. The latter is in line with the
European Cycling Federation, Dutch Cycling Embassy recommendations and
the European RISM Directive, for reporting collision rates of vulnerable
road users by 2024. These factors mean that the tool can be seen as an
open access `leverage point' in the planning system
\citep{lovelace2020}.

The rest of paper is structured as follows. In
Section~\ref{sec-methods}, we outline the methods used to generate the
evidence presented in the CRUSE Tool for Ireland. In
Section~\ref{sec-results}, we present the results of the CRUSE Tool,
including estimates of current cycling levels and future cycling
potential at the national, regional and local levels. In
Section~\ref{sec-discussion}, we discuss the implications of the results
for policy and practice. In Section~\ref{sec-conclusions}, we conclude
the paper.

\hypertarget{sec-methods}{%
\section{Methods and data}\label{sec-methods}}

The methods used to generate the evidence presented in the CRUSE Tool
for Ireland build on the Propensity to Cycle Tool (PCT), which was
originally funded by the UK's Department for Transport and developed by
a multi-university team. An important feature of the PCT is that it is
open source and publicly available (at
\href{https://www.pct.bike/}{www.pct.bike}), allowing its use by all
stakeholders in the transport planning process \citep{lovelace2017}. The
PCT approach has had major policy impacts, as outlined in Research
Excellence Framework (REF) impact case studies, which demonstrate that
the tool ``revolutionised strategic cycle planning in England and
Wales''\footnote{See REF Impact Case Study ``Cycle network policy,
  planning and investment transformed by the Propensity to Cycle Tool''
  at
  \href{https://results2021.ref.ac.uk/impact/847d1191-7f25-46ba-a399-b481125edc8f}{results2021.ref.ac.uk}
  submitted by the University of Leeds.} by overcoming the barriers to
cycling investment imposed by lack of evidence on cycling
potential\footnote{See the REF Impact Case Study ``Creating Step Changes
  in Cycling Policy and Infrastructure Planning across the UK'' at
  \href{https://results2021.ref.ac.uk/impact/4BBF3436-FD10-4C75-9791-F5E98AB4411B}{results2021.ref.ac.uk}
  submitted by the University of Westminster.} .

The first version of the PCT was based on current and future potential
uptake of cycling for single stage \emph{travel to work} at desire line,
zone, route, and route network levels \citep{lovelace2016}. It was
launched in April 2017 as the government-endorsed tool for strategic
cycle network planning, as part of the Cycling and Walking Investment
Strategy \citep{cycling2017}. Extensions of the PCT approach have
included estimation of benefits at the individual level
\citep{woodcock2018}, addition of travel to school network
\citep{goodman2019}, and improved modelling of impacts on health,
environmental and distributional outcomes \citep{woodcock2021}.
Initially developed just for England, the PCT was extended to cover all
of Wales (for commuter data only) in 2018.

The PCT approach has been applied in other countries, including Ireland
(the topic of this paper), Scotland, and Portugal. In Portugal the
`biclaR' project, based on methods underlying the PCT, has been
developed and deployed for the Lisbon metro region. The resulting
evidence is available in an interactive web application hosted at
\href{https://biclar.tmlmobilidade.pt}{biclar.tmlmobilidade.pt}
\citep{felix2023}. biclaR includes estimates of impacts, using the World
Health Organisation (WHO) `HEAT for Cycling' tool\footnote{See the
  Health economic assessment tool for walking and cycling at
  \href{https://www.heatwalkingcycling.org/\#homepage}{www.heatwalkingcycling.org}.}
and an `intermodality' scenario that combines cycling with currently
available public transit options based on General Transit Feed
Specification (GTFS) data.

The CRUSE Tool seeks to overcome the following methodological
limitations of the original PCT:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Low resolution of data, with routes starting and ending in
  administrative zone centroids
\item
  Limited coverage of trip purposes beyond travel to work and school
\item
  A web interface that was not user-friendly or intuitive
\end{itemize}

Methods were developed to overcome each of these, as outlined in
Section~\ref{sec-trip-purposes} to Section~\ref{sec-ui}.

\hypertarget{sec-disaggregation}{%
\subsection{Disaggregation of origin-destination
data}\label{sec-disaggregation}}

A feature of active travel interventions is that they require dense
networks of routes to be effective \citep{parkin2018}. This means that
high levels of geographic resolution are needed in the data used to
estimate cycling potential. However, datasets on travel patterns are
often only available at the level of administrative zones. The Central
Statistics Office (CSO) in Ireland provides Place of Work, School or
College Census of Anonymised Records
(\href{https://www.cso.ie/en/census/census2016reports/powscar/}{POWSCAR})
data on the number of people travelling to work and school at the
Electoral Division (ED) level, for example.

The method used to convert OD data to route networks used in the PCT was
to calculate a single route between the population weighted centroids
associated with each OD pair. This method works fine when the OD data
represents movement between small areas, but was not appropriate for
generating route networks from the POWSCAR data because zone centroids
are so far apart that the resulting route networks would be sparse and
unrealistic. To tackle this issue we developed a new method for OD data
disaggregation called `jittering' \citep{lovelace2022}. The method works
by first disaggregating the OD data based on a `disaggregation
threshold' and then assigning each disaggregated `sub-OD' pair to
`subpoints' within each zone. As shown in Figure~\ref{fig-dublin}, the
resulting route networks are dense, even in rural areas.

\hypertarget{sec-trip-purposes}{%
\subsection{Additional trip purposes}\label{sec-trip-purposes}}

A limitation of the original PCT was that it only included travel to
work data. This was partially addressed by the inclusion of travel to
school based on data from the Department for Education in England
\citep{goodman2019}. An advantage of the POWSCAR OD data over OD
datasets derived from census surveys in many countries is that it
includes travel to school data. We commissioned a version of POWSCAR
that included a breakdown of the total flows between OD pairs by purpose
and mode, enabling a more realistic estimation of the `Baseline' cycling
network.

However, travel to school and work only constitute around only 30\% of
all trips in Ireland. To overcome this issue, we developed a spatial
interaction modelling methodology to estimate the number of trips
between each OD pair for additional trip purposes. The classification of
trip purposes used in the CRUSE Tool was guided mainly by the trip
purpose classification found within the National Household Travel Survey
(NHTS), but with the addition of categories based on the comprehensive
POWSCAR data, and the need to include recreational trips and multi-stage
trips (not yet implemented). An overview of the trip purposes used in
CRUSE is presented in Figure~\ref{fig-trip-purposes}.

\begin{figure}

{\centering 

\includegraphics{images/paste-4.png}

}

\caption{\label{fig-trip-purposes}Trip purposes used in the CRUSE Tool.}

\end{figure}

\hypertarget{sec-ui}{%
\subsection{User interface}\label{sec-ui}}

The CRUSE web application is statically hosted, meaning that it can be
accessed without the need for a server running software such as the R
package `shiny' or Python packages such as `streamlit' or `flask' in the
background \citep{wickham2021}. Typical intended user stories are
illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig-user-stories}, which shows that the tool
is designed to be used by both professional and non-professional users.
For the main target audience, professional transport planners working at
the county level, the tool provides a range of outputs, including
estimates of cycling potential at the county and network level. The
provision of balanced (the default), quietest and fastest route networks
enables planners to consider the trade-offs between directness and
`cycle friendliness' when planning new infrastructure. The tool also
provides data downloads, enabling estimates of cycling potential on the
network to be visualised and analysed with other tools such as QGIS,
Python or R.

For non-professional users, the tool provides a simple interface to
explore the cycling potential of the network. By providing a single
landing page that is suitable for both professional and non-professional
users (such as an advocate or parent interested in safe routes to
school), the tool aims to facilitate communication between these groups.

Tool illustrating that it can be used in different ways by different
user groups.}

\end{figure}

\hypertarget{sec-results}{%
\section{Results}\label{sec-results}}

The main result of the CRUSE project is an open access web application
and datasets on current and potential future cycling levels in Ireland,
with evidence provided at county and route segment levels. Like the PCT
on which CRUSE builds, a key feature of the results is that they are
systematic and available for all counties, and most routes on which
cycling is permitted, in Ireland. The full set of results are therefore
too extensive to present in their entirety in this paper. Through the
interactive web application, users can explore the data to generate the
results that are most relevant to their needs, whether that is finding
the cycling potential on a particular road or finding `weak links' or
barriers in the cycle network associated with a particular school, work
place or other destination.

Instead of trying to show such use cases, of which there are many
hundreds, we present a selection of results to illustrate the main
features of the CRUSE Tool.

To illustrate the results in urban areas, we took the top 4 cities in
Ireland by population: Dublin City, Cork, Limerick and Galway (with city
populations of 0.6, 0.2, 0.1 and 0.1 million respectively). The results
for central areas demarcated with circular areas with a radius of 3km
for these cities are presented in Figure~\ref{fig-city-results}.

\begin{figure}

{\centering 

\includegraphics{images/rnet_types.png}

}

\caption{\label{fig-city-results}Fastest, balanced and quietest cycle
networks within 3km circular areas containing the four largest cities in
Ireland. The networks are coloured by cycle friendliness and with widths
varying in proportion to the potential level of cycling under the `Go
Dutch' scenario.}

\end{figure}

Aside from the widely varying sizes and route networks of each city,
with Dublin having by far the densest network, it is clear from the
visualisation of cycling friendliness that there is a lot of room for
improvement in all cities. Dublin has had received most investment in
cycling infrastructure and this is apparent from the high proportion of
the route network that is green, even in the `Fastest' route network
representing routes that prioritise speed and directness over comfort
and safety. Dublin also has the highest mode share of cycling of the
four cities, adding to the evidence base showing that investment in
cycling infrastructure is effective in increasing cycling uptake.

Although Dublin City has made progress, there are still many parts of
the Fastest route network, and even some parts of the Balanced and
Quietest route networks, that are not cycle friendly and which have high
cycling potential. According to a recent report, 71\% of residents in
the Dublin Metropolitan Area support ``more cycle tracks along roads,
physically separated from traffic and pedestrians''.\footnote{https://www.nationaltransport.ie/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/220504-WACI22\_DublinMetropolitanArea\_v35\_DIGITAL\_v2.pdf}
The results for the Dublin area could help prioritise investment in
cycling infrastructure in the city.

\hypertarget{sec-discussion}{%
\section{Discussion}\label{sec-discussion}}

The CRUSE Tool provides evidence on current and potential future cycling
levels across Ireland down to the street level, with potential assigned
to `fastest', `balanced' and `quietest' route networks. This provision
of multiple scenarios of behaviour changes \emph{and} multiple scenarios
of investment, for example in cycling infrastructure next to major roads
vs quiet residential streets, is a key feature of the CRUSE Tool.

As highlighted in a paper on cycling infrastructure preferences based on
a case study of Dublin, both directness and quietness are important
\citep{caulfield2012}:

\begin{quote}
Direct routes with short journey times were found to be the most
important positive variable for existing cyclists and non-cyclists in
determining route choice. This is followed by infrastructure type, the
number of junctions along the route, traffic speed and cyclist volumes.
In terms if infrastructure, regardless of the level of cycling
confidence, routes which have `no facilities' or `bus/cycle lanes' are
the least favoured cycle route types.
\end{quote}

The CRUSE Tool can help both in terms of describing the current
situation, and also prioritise investment in those direct routes with
high cycling potential that lack adequate cycling infrastructure,
highlighted by \citet{caulfield2012}. It will also support reporting for
the RISM Directive on road casualties as part of the road safety
management system.

While the CRUSE Tool is not the first national and publicly available
tool for cycling planning, it has some unique features that make it
relevant for other countries, and other national road authorities tasked
with making their transport systems safe.

TODO: outline these features.

The CRUSE Tool is designed to be used by a wide range of stakeholders,
including transport planners, engineers, and other professionals, as
well as non-professionals.
