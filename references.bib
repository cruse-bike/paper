	abstract = {Cycling has been recognized as one of the solutions to urban transportation challenges. In 2013, Singapore has announced the National Cycling Plan to signiﬁcantly increase the cycling infrastructure and promote cycling across the entire country by 2030. Given Singapore's land constraints, planning the most eﬀective cycling network is critical. Moreover, there has been growing pressure to incorporate public participation in planning decisions. In order to achieve ideal planning outcomes and greater transparency in planning, multiple criteria and the perspectives of diﬀerent stakeholders need to be considered. This paper proposes a Geographical Information System-based multi-criteria decision analysis (GIS-MCDA) framework for the support of cycling paths planning in Singapore. It is positioned to address the lacuna in the literature that is dominated by westerncentric case studies and a ﬁxation on only infrastructural and objective factors in the planning of cycling paths. The proposed cycling paths planning support framework will be implemented in Woodlands Planning Area (WPA). The primary research questions are about where to build cycling paths in WPA and whether/how the cycling paths to be built will change based on diﬀerent stakeholders' preferences. The cycling paths planning support framework is able to incorporate diﬀerent stakeholders' preferences into various scenarios, hence can improve the engagement between stakeholders and contribute to greater transparency in Singapore's cycling paths planning. The limitations and further applications of the framework is also discussed.},

	abstract = {Getting people cycling is an increasingly common objective in transport planning institutions worldwide. A growing evidence base indicates that high quality infrastructure can boost local cycling rates. Yet for infrastructure and other cycling measures to be eﬀective, it is important to intervene in the right places, such as along ‘desire lines’ of high latent demand. is creates the need for tools and methods to help answer the question ‘where to build?’. Following a brief review of the policy and research context related to this question, this paper describes the design, features and potential applications of such a tool. e Propensity to Cycle Tool (PCT) is an online, interactive planning support system that was initially developed to explore and map cycling potential across England (see www.pct.bike). Based on origin-destination data it models cycling levels at area, desire line, route and route network levels, for current levels of cycling, and for scenario-based ‘cycling futures.’ Four scenarios are presented, including ‘Go Dutch’ and ‘Ebikes,’ which explore what would happen if English people had the same propensity to cycle as Dutch people and the potential impact of electric cycles on cycling uptake. e cost eﬀectiveness of investment depends not only on the number of additional trips cycled, but on wider impacts such as health and carbon beneﬁts. e PCT reports these at area, desire line, and route level for each scenario. e PCT is open source, facilitating the creation of scenarios and deployment in new contexts. We conclude that the PCT illustrates the potential of online tools to inform transport decisions and raises the wider issue of how models should be used in transport planning.},

	abstract = {Background: There is growing interest in designing cities that support not only walking, but also cycling. Bike Score® is a metric capturing environmental characteristics associated with cycling that is now available for over 160 US and Canadian cities. Our aim was to determine if Bike Score was associated with between and within-city variability in cycling behavior.
Methods: We used linear regression to model associations between Bike Score and journey to work cycling mode share (US: American Community Survey, 2013 or 2012 5-year estimates; Canada: 2011 National Household Survey) for 5664 census tracts in 24 US and Canadian cities.
Results: At the city level, the correlation between mean Bike Score and mean journey to work cycling mode share was moderate (r = 0.52). At the census tract level, the correlation was 0.35; a ten-unit increase in Bike Score was associated with a 0.5 \% (95 \% CI: 0.5 to 0.6) increase in the proportion of population cycling to work, a meaningful difference given the low modal shares (mean = 1.9 \%) in many North American cities. Census tracts with the highest Bike Scores ({\textgreater}90 to 100) had mode shares 4.0 \% higher (β = 4.0, 95 \% CI: 2.9 to 5.0) than the lowest Bike Score areas (0–25). City specific analyses indicated between-city variability in associations, with regression estimates between Bike Score and mode share ranging from 0.2 to 3.5 \%.
Conclusions: The Bike Score metric was associated bicycle mode share between and within cities, suggesting its utility for planning bicycle infrastructure.},

Comparatively little attention has been paid to understanding the usefulness of PSS for planning practice and studying its application in real-world planning situations. This paper aims to address this omission. Conceptually, usefulness is subdivided in seven dimensions, and explained by the usability and utility of the PSS. This framework is applied to a case study with Urban Strategy – a PSS based on combined environmental and trafﬁc models. A workshop with this PSS was studied using a questionnaire, interviews and observations. The ﬁndings indicate that in addition to the more commonly used concept of usability, utility (understood as task–technology ﬁt) is helpful to understand the usefulness of a PSS application. This concept, for instance, helps to indicate when a PSS has a negative effect on planning tasks. Moreover, in addition to usability and utility, context turned out to be critical to understand the usefulness of a PSS application.},

	abstract = {A model is presented that relates the proportion of bicycle journeys to work for English and Welsh electoral wards to relevant socio-economic, transport and physical variables. A number of previous studies have exploited existing disaggregate data sets. This study uses UK 2001 census data, is based on a logistic regression model and provides complementary evidence based on aggregate data for the determinants of cycle choice. It suggests a saturation level for bicycle use of 43\%. Smaller proportions cycle in wards with more females and higher car ownership. The physical condition of the highway, rainfall and temperature each have an effect on the proportion that cycles to work, but the most signiﬁcant physical variable is hilliness. The proportion of bicycle route that is off-road is shown to be signiﬁcant, although it displays a low elasticity (+0.049) and this contrasts with more signiﬁcant changes usually forecast by models constructed from stated preference based data. Forecasting shows the trend in car ownership has a signiﬁcant effect on cycle use and offsets the positive effect of the provision of off-road routes for cycle trafﬁc but only in districts that are moderately hilly or hilly. The provision of infrastructure alone appears insufﬁcient to engender higher levels of cycling.},

This article uses Montre´al, Canada, as a case study to demonstrate various methods for locating facilities.

Those with reduced bicycle modal shares, identified as ‘starter cycling cities’ face several challenges, particularly due to a lack of cycling tradition and technical know-how. Existing research and solutions, mostly targeted to cities in more advanced stages of cycling promotion, limit the effectiveness of available options to policy makers. The Gross Potential for Cycling is a PSS is grounded on fundamental research on the aspects influencing bicycle use, notably natural features, urban structure and socioeconomic factors. Steering away from the assessment of pre-existing bicycle infrastructure and attitudes, it generates a territorial assessment of the potential for cycling, aiming at the development of targeted and customized policies for different areas within the same city.},
